                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This Learning to Rank (LTR) project optimized search rankings for NAPA Auto Parts'
                     e-commerce platform, ensuring customers find the most relevant products at the top
                      of their search results. The project involved training a machine learning model 
                      that ranks products based on historical user interactions, such as clicks, add-to-carts,
                       and purchases. By leveraging Google Cloud Vertex AI and XGBoost ranking algorithms, 
                       the system was able to learn customer preferences and dynamically adjust search rankings. 
                       The model was trained on millions of search queries spanning a 90-day period, capturing 
                       patterns in user behavior and improving product relevance.

                    A key technical challenge was data preprocessing and feature engineering, 
                    where raw search logs needed to be transformed into a structured dataset 
                    for training the ranking model. This required extensive SQL queries in 
                    Google BigQuery to extract user interactions and assign relevance scores 
                    to products. Once the data pipeline was built, the LTR model was fine-tuned 
                    using hyperparameter optimization, leading to an NDCG (Normalized Discounted 
                    Cumulative Gain) improvement of 20%. The solution was integrated with Flask, 
                    Java Spring Boot, and React, ensuring seamless deployment into the existing NAPA 
                    Auto Parts search infrastructure. This ranking enhancement is projected to drive 
                    a 30% increase in revenue, significantly improving the e-commerce experience for customers.
